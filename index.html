        <p>Fun Fact: "Omegle, a video chat service that connected strangers, shut down after 14 years. The chat site was forced to shut down by a lawsuit from a sexual abuse survivor. Omegle had a long-standing problem of pairing minors with sexual predators." (Honestly parents should watch their kids more, more so online.)</p>
